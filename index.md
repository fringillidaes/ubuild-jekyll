  headline: "<strong>BB-8</strong> Discord Bot (based on <strong>Red</strong> Discord
    Bot)"
  content: BB-8 is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be
    enabled/disabled to your liking, making it completely customizable. This is also
    a <em>self-hosted bot</em> – meaning you will need to host and maintain your own
    instance. You can turn Red into an admin bot, music bot, trivia bot, new best
    friend or all of these together!
